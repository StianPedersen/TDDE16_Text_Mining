    "We remove common stop words since they don't add any information about the topic of the document for example 'the' will be used in almost every document and doesn't help us to extract document specific information. We lemmatise the words since different forms of different words usually have the same semantic meaning and differentiating between different forms therefore doesn't give us any additional information. An example of an application-specific stop word could be 'game' if we're looking at descriptions of games since almost every description will contain the word and thus it doesn't add information when analyzing different game descriptions.\n",

    "The rows are the number of documents and the columns represent the amount of terms(words) in the dataset. The representations are the tf-idfs of all of the terms which is the term frequency multiplied with the inverse document frequency. This gives all the terms a weight that is supposed to represent how important the term is to the document. When we do this transformation we lose the semantic meaning of the descriptions since we only have a number for how important a term is but not what it means.\n",
    "1.3\n",
    "If a term has a high idf it means that the term is not in that many of the documents and a low idf means that the term is in almost all of the documents. Since a low idf means that a term is in almost all of the documents we can assume that it doesn't contain additional information. So one could automatically create stopwords from terms with a idf under a certain threshold. If only idf was used to as term-weighting rare words would get very high weights even if they are not used frequently in the document. And if a term is very frequent in a few documents it would be weighted lower than an unusual term used one time in one document. This in combination with our intuitive belief of how humans write(using topic specific words frequently) makes us believe that idf only weighted terms would give poor information about the documents."
